## Project Overview
 **AmpAware Smart Plug Base** is designed to address everyday challenges related to energy management and control over electrical appliances. Based on
 identified user needs, the device provides remote and manual control, real-time power monitoring,
 and safety features, all integrated into a compact and user-friendly designThe product is aimed at tech-savvy consumers and households looking to optimize energy consumption while maintaining control over their electrical devices from anywhere via the **Blynk IoT platform**.

Unlike a fully smart home system, **AmpAware** allows targeted control of specific appliances, making automation more cost-effective and accessible. It is compact, easy to install, and provides smart energy monitoring with surge protection to ensure safety.

## Problem Statement & Justification
Many households face energy management challenges, including:
- **Forgotten Appliances**: Devices left on unnecessarily, leading to energy waste. Also it can even cause the fires.
- **Lack of Energy Data**: No real-time tracking of power usage.
- **High Electricity Bills**: Inefficient energy consumption.

Existing smart home systems can be expensive and require a full home upgrade. **AmpAware Smart Plug Base** offers an affordable and customizable solution, enabling users to automate and monitor individual appliances instead of committing to a full smart home conversion.
